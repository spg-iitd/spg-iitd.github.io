# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand security issues in different application areas such as IoT, vehicular networks, 5G/6G etc. 

<!-- Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics and instrumentation. -->

Here are some projects that we currently work on:

**5G Cellular Network Security** We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.


**Adversarial AI Attacks and Defenses in Intrusion Detection System for IoT** To facilitate applications such as smart home and smart manufacturing, energy-constrained devices are inter-connected through bandwidth-constrained communication protocols to form the internet-of-things (IoT). Due to such constraints, the IoT networks fail to employ conventional security protocols. Hence, on one hand, the IoT devices are vulnerable to illegal device access and inference of sensitive information; on the other hand, their users are prone to spoofing attacks through which an attacker can feed malicious data to the user. One resource-efficient way to secure an IoT network is to deploy comprehensively trained intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, the existing IDS have been shown to be vulnerable against modern artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted attacks that exploit specific vulnerabilities of the IDS.

In this project, we will address this challenge by developing an adversarial AI-driven framework to design a novel IDS which can detect AI-assisted cyber-attacks on IoT networks. This study will require extensive efforts along three research thrusts:

We will first develop a systematic fuzzing-based method to discover the attack surfaces which can be exploited through modern AI techniques for evading the state-of-the-art IDS for IoT networks.
We will then develop a novel framework that will utilize the concepts of adversarial ML to learn robust detection mechanisms for such attacks.
Finally, we will utilize the developed framework to design an IDS which will not only detect the AI-assisted attacks with high detection rate, but also employ novel techniques to minimize the number of potential false alarms (false positive and negative). We will analyze the effectiveness of the proposed IDS by conducting experiments on simulated IoT networks as well as on a testbed with real-world IoT devices.


**Adversarial Cyber-Attacks and Defences for In-Vehicle Networks** A lot of recent automobiles have adopted AI techniques to provide autonomous and safe driving. However, there are cybersecurity attacks on intelligent vehicles and their infrastructure and they have become a big risk to the automobile industry and customers.

The main goal of this research project is to develop adversarial attacks and defences for in-vehicle networks. Machine Learning (ML) techniques (including deep learning techniques) have been applied to intrusion detection for in-vehicle networks. The main function of ML-based intrusion detection is to monitor, identify cyber attacks to in-vehicle networks, in particular, CAN bus. Adversarial attacks are critical security threats against deployed ML- based intrusion detection for in-vehicle networks. In this research, existing adversarial attacks will be tested against offline and deployed ML-based intrusion detection for in-vehicle networks and also novel adversarial attacks will be developed to evaluate the robustness of ML-based intrusion detection. In addition, defences against adversarial attacks will be developed against adversarial attacks and their effectiveness will be assessed via multiple metrics.


<!-- **Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren. 

**Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.**

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
