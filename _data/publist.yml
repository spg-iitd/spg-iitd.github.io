- title: "SpotOn: Adversarially Robust Keyword Spotting on Resource-Constrained IoT Platforms"
  image:
  description: IoT devices (e.g., voice assistants) that execute real-time speech commands are proliferating fast in our daily lives. In such a device, detecting the correct keyword spoken as a command triggers the supported function, and hence keyword spotting (KWS) using a machine learning (ML) model is the pivotal task in their functioning. However, KWS is vulnerable to adversarial machine learning (AML)-based attacks through which an adversary can craft an adversarial...

- title: "SPAT: Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Transformation for Perceptually Similar Adversarial Examples"
  image: SPAT.png
  description: Machine Learning~(ML) models are vulnerable to adversarial machine learning~(AML) attacks, which generate adversarial examples by adding well-crafted perturbations to the benign examples. If the perturbations are added without considering the semantic correctness, the attack can be easily detected. We introduce SPAT, a unified framework that transforms conventional AML attacks into semantic-preserving versions while maintaining a comparable attack success rate.

- title: "Practical Attestation for Edge Devices Running Compute Heavy Machine Learning Applications"
  image:
  description: Machine Learning (EdgeML) algorithms on edge devices facilitate safety-critical applications like building security management and smart city interventions. However, their wired/wireless connections with the Internet make such platforms vulnerable to attacks compromising the embedded software. In this paper, we present PracAttest, a practical runtime attestation framework for embedded devices running compute-heavy EdgeML applications. Unlike the conventional remote attestation...

#   description: Shot noise has been suggested for a long time as a tell-tale probe for Majorana bound states. We are the first to carry out local tunneling shot noise measurements on the putative vortex Majorana states.
