- title: "Robust Intrusion Detection"
  description: Our research focuses on developing advanced intrusion detection systems capable of safeguarding diverse environments. 
               We examine smart home networks, automotive systems, drone communications, speech recognition systems, and edge 
               computing infrastructures. By analyzing network traffic patterns, device behavior, and user interactions, 
               we aim to detect anomalies indicative of malicious activity. Our goal is to create resilient systems that 
               can identify and respond to emerging threats while minimizing false positives and ensuring minimal performance impact.

  description: Our research focuses on developing efficient and secure authentication mechanisms for resource-constrained environments. 
               By examining data from 5G user equipment, 5G base stations, and IoT devices, we aim to create lightweight cryptographic 
               solutions that protect data integrity and authenticity without compromising system performance. Our goal is to enable 
               secure communication and data exchange in resource-limited settings.

               protect biometric data, including storage and authentication, while ensuring data integrity and availability. 
               Additionally, we explore privacy-enhancing technologies for safeguarding mobile user data in dynamic environments. 
               Our goal is to create resilient systems that can withstand privacy attacks and maintain individual privacy rights.

# - title: "Adversarial AI Attacks and Defenses in Intrusion Detection System for IoT"
#   description: To facilitate applications such as smart homes and smart manufacturing, energy-constrained devices 
#                are interconnected through bandwidth-constrained communication protocols to form the Internet of 
#                Things (IoT). Due to such constraints, the IoT networks fail to employ conventional security 
#                protocols. Hence, on one hand, the IoT devices are vulnerable to illegal device access and inference 
#                of sensitive information; on the other hand, their users are prone to spoofing attacks through 
#                which an attacker can feed malicious data to the user. One resource-efficient way to secure an 
#                IoT network is to deploy comprehensively trained intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, the 
#                existing IDS have been shown to be vulnerable against modern artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 
#                attacks that exploit specific vulnerabilities of the IDS.

# - title: "Towards Securing Next Generation Cellular Network for IoT"
#   description: The fifth generation of cellular networks (5G) implements software-defined networking (SDN) 
#                and network function virtualisation (NFV) to provide scalability and flexibility, reduce 
#                costs, and decouple control and data planes. 5G cellular networks employ service-based 
#                architecture, which is native to the cloud and uses micro-services. It enables the creation 
#                of tailored services that cater to different deployment conditions, such as voice, video, 
#                e-health, smart city, and self-driving cars. With network slicing, the internet service 
#                provider can efficiently use spectrum and compute resources to provide the necessary quality 
#                of service based on the application. Network slicing security is a significant issue since a 
#                security threat in being a 5G enabler would imply jeopardy of the entire 5G system. With 
#                applications in safety-critical cyber-physical systems, even service degradation may lead 
#                to the loss of human life.

# - title: "Adversarial Cyber-Attacks and Defences for In-Vehicle Networks"
#   description: The main goal of this research project is to develop adversarial attacks and defences for in-vehicle 
#                networks. Machine Learning (ML) techniques (including deep learning techniques) have been applied 
#                to intrusion detection for in-vehicle networks. The main function of ML-based intrusion detection 
#                is to monitor, identify cyber attacks to in-vehicle networks, in particular, CAN bus. Adversarial 
#                attacks are critical security threats against deployed ML- based intrusion detection for in-vehicle 
#                networks. In this research, existing adversarial attacks will be tested against offline and deployed 
#                ML-based intrusion detection for in-vehicle networks and also novel adversarial attacks will be 
#                developed to evaluate the robustness of ML-based intrusion detection. In addition, defences against 
#                adversarial attacks will be developed against adversarial attacks and their effectiveness will be 
#                assessed via multiple metrics.

# - title: "Towards Securing 5G Cellular Network from Fake Base Stations"
#   description: The research focuses on the problem of fake base stations within 5G cellular networks. 
#                Exploiting the cellular device's tendency to connect to the strongest signal, adversaries 
#                can set up rogue base stations with higher signal strengths, attracting nearby devices. These 
#                fake base stations facilitate attacks like denial of service and relay attacks. This 
#                research aims to detect and prevent such impersonation, with a particular emphasis on 
#                authentication relay attacks that manipulate device location information.

# - title: "Lightweight Intrusion Detection System for Resource-constraint End-points"
#   description: Lightweight Intrusion Detection System for Resource Constrained Endpoints focussing on three 
#                dimensions of improvements - Optimal IDS, Distributed IDS and Filtered IDS. Optimal IDS focusses 
#                on making intrusion detection engine optimal i.e. choosing better algorithms having resource 
#                footprint minimized. Distributed IDS focusses on sharing engine load to multiple nodes. Filtered 
#                IDS focusses on processing a subset of activities by taking intelligent decisions like sampling 
#                or monitoring only specific type of events on an endpoint depending on workload running. All the 
#                three improvement areas will quantify the goodness of the IDS in efficacy, latency and resource 
#                usage.
