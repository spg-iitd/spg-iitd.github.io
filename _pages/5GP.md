# Research

**Towards securing next-generation cellular network for IoT:** The fifth generation of cellular networks (5G) implements software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualisation (NFV) to provide scalability and flexibility, reduce costs, and decouple control and data planes. 5G cellular networks employ service-based architecture, which is native to the cloud and uses micro-services. It enables the creation of tailored services that cater to different deployment conditions, such as voice, video, e-health, smart city, and self-driving cars. With network slicing, the internet service provider can efficiently use spectrum and compute resources to provide the necessary quality of service based on the application. Network slicing security is a significant issue since a security threat in being a 5G enabler would imply jeopardy of the entire 5G system. With applications in safety-critical cyber-physical systems, even service degradation may lead to the loss of human life. 

With my PhD dissertation, I aim to significantly enhance the robustness of the core network against external network threats. This includes developing a robust testing methodology and building a comprehensive testbed with good coverage of deployment scenarios and 3GPP standards. I also plan to study attacks against a crucial area of research with potential implications for the security of 5G networks. In the context of cellular networks, the potential for side-channel leak availability ink of end-network user privacy is another area where my research could have a significant impact. Finally, I propose a detection and prevention system to deal with attacks effectively in real-time.
