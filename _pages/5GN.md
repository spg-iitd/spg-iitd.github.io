**Problem of fake base stations in the 5G cellular networks:** The cellular devices are programmed to connect to a base station with strongest signal strength. The unencrypted broadcast messages can be used to setup a rogue base station with higher signal strength. This will attract all the nearby cellular devices which will try to connect using the rogue base station. The fake base station is capable of launching attacks like Denial of Service(DoS), relay attacks and others. Our work focusses on the detection of these impersonating base stations and come up with methods to prevent the attacks arising from them. We are currently interested in the detection and prevention of authentication relay attack. This attack uses a fake base station to forge location of cellular devices.
