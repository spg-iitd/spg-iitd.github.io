# Research

**Securing Machine learning application running on resource-constrained edge devices:** My research interests lie at the intersection of Systems and Machine learning. I aim to develop secure, reliable, and privacy-preserving edge AI technology. Specifically, I am focused on developing solutions to protect Machine Learning applications running on resource-constrained edge devices from malware and adversarial machine
learning attacks. My primary objective is to ensure that the inferences made on the edge device are reliable under all circumstances, especially in high-stakes decision-making areas. This involves ensuring code and data integrity, protection from adversarial machine-learning attacks and runtime control-flow attacks.
