**Lightweight Intrusion Detection System for Resource Constrained Endpoints:** This work focusses on three dimensions of improvements - Optimal IDS, Distributed IDS and Filtered IDS. Optimal IDS focusses on making intrusion detection engine optimal i.e. choosing better algorithms having resource footprint minimized. Distributed IDS focusses on sharing engine load to multiple nodes. Filtered IDS focusses on processing a subset of activities by taking intelligent decisions like sampling or monitoring only specific type of events on an endpoint depending on workload running. All the three improvement areas will quantify the goodness of the IDS in efficacy, latency and resource usage.
